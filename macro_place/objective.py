Proxy cost computation using PlacementCost's ground truth evaluator.

Components returned by PlacementCost (used for ``proxy_cost`` and diagnostics):

* **wirelength_cost** — normalized HPWL across all nets (``plc.get_cost()``).
* **density_cost** — top 10% grid cell density (``plc.get_density_cost()``).
* **congestion_cost** — top 5% routing congestion with smoothing (``plc.get_congestion_cost()``).

Also computes overlap metrics for validation and analysis.
